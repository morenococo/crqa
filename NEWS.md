# crqa (cross-recurrence quantification analysis)

# crqa 2.0.6

* Rewritten jspd.f from 77 to Fortran compiler 90/95 (jspd.f90)

* Substituted the plotRP function with a more modern and customizable plot_rp function which is build on top of the ggplot2() ecosystem

* Added a method check to crqa() such that it will stop, rather than simply default, if one of the methods available is not correctly specified

* When method "mdcrqa" is used within crqa(), time-series will be z-scored using the scale() function as to keep each time-series independently 

* Removed the plot3D option from lorenzattractor.R and so the dependency to this package.

* Fixed the mdFnn function such that the first estimate for the embedding parameter is contingent on the data structure.  Also, relaxed the constraint that the size of the data matrix must be bigger 1, so that the function can be used with unidimensional time series.

* In optimizeParam(), when estimating false.nearest we incorporate the identified optimal delay and (if it exists) the user-specified maximum embedding dimension.

# crqa 2.0.5

* Amended plotRP() to handle better visualization 

* Checked calculation of categorical entropy (catH) and adjusted threshold to < .01 to compute it 

* Fixed issues with introducing RPs as argument for wincrqa 

# crqa 2.0.4

* Mostly fixed a couple of minor issues with wincrqa()

  * Added a warning in wincrqa() when users set delay and embedding dimension bigger than window size.
  
  * Added the calculation of nr. of windows for method `rqa`, i.e., unidimensional recurrence, which was missing

* Removed from `crqa_package.Rd` information about package version as it was conflicting with DESCRIPTION

* Added proper article CITATION to the package

# crqa 2.0.3

* Fixed minor bug on drpfromts() when method was `mdcrqa`. The argument `datatype` was forcing the input data to be in vector form, and should instead be left as a matrix. Added if statement to check (line 25)

# crqa 2.0.1

* Fixed bug on wincrqa() and windowdrp() to run windowed RQA on multidimensional data.
    * Simplified output of wincrqa() now returning a dataframe
    * Included new import from FSA() package to use diags() function. 

# crqa 2.0.0

* Major features

  * Extension of recurrence analysis to multidimensional time-series data, and significant update of computational procedures in `crqa()`
    * Added arguments: `method`, `metric` and `datatype`
    * Improved method for phase-space reconstruction (line 207:237)
    * Included computation of categorical entropy (line 411:420)
    * Removal of argument `checkl`
    
  * Simplified structure of functions and better division between core and ancillary functions:
    * `crqa_helpers` contains several functions previously exported (e.g., `theiler` or `tt`) that are now only accessed internally by the `crqa()` package.
    
  * New functions `mdDelay()` and `mdFnn()` to estimate Average Mutual Information and False Nearest Neighbours of multidimensional time-series.

  * Experimental `piecewiseRQA()` function created to better handle the computational load of large time-series.

  * `optimizeParam()` now works also with multidimensional time-series. 
    
* Minor features

  * Deprecated functions: `CTcrqa()`, `runcrqa()`, `calcphi()`, `takephi()`

  * On `crqa()` 
    * improved error checking and warning messages (line 133:170)
    * added two more ways of rescaling the distance matrix (line 252:272)
    
  * On `plotRP()` added arguments to improve the plotting of Recurrence Plots 

  * `drpdfromts()` is now called `drpfromts()` and it has been rewritten to align with the new version of `crqa()`.

  * A convenience function called `numerify` in `crqa_helpers` is automatically called when a user inputs categorical series (i.e., it contains either characters or factors) and this function is used to recode the levels of such time-series into numerical codes (to run crqa). A warning is send to the user when `crqa()`.

  * `windowdrp()` has been rewritten to align with the new version of `crqa()`.  

  * `wincrqa()` has been rewritten to align with the new version of `crqa()` and better names for the output were provided.  

# crqa 1.0.9

* On `drpdfromts()` removed a left over constant used for testing (line: 42)

# crqa 1.0.8

* Improvements and bug fixes

  * On `drpdfromts()` fixed initialisation of dimensions for empty RP (line: 52)

# crqa 1.0.7

* New functions

  * `plotRP()` convenience function based on the standard `plot()` to visualize a Recurrence Plot

* Improvements and bug fixes

  * On `crqa()` added a few more checks (`stop`) if the data inputted did not comply with the function, and send a warning message.

  * `drpdfromts()` entirely rewritten around `crqa()` to better deal with continuous valued time-series.

  * `runcrqa()` fixed to fit with the revised functions: `drpdfromts()` and `windowdrp()`, 

  * `tt()` fixed `rBind` (line 23 and 91) which was deprecated from the `Matrix()` package.

  * `windowdrp()`entirely rewritten around the new version of `drpdfromts()` 

  * `wincrqa()` adjusted indexing of windows (line: 40:41)

* Improvements and bug fixes

  * On `crqa()` include a `stop` (line: 95:100) if time-series were shorter than their phase space reconstructed portaits

  * On `optimizeParam()` included argument `typeami` to set the type of `ami()` desired (either, minimum dip or maximum lag)

# crqa 1.0.5

* Improvements and bug fixes

  * On `checkts()`. added argument `pad` (line: 38:67), which gives the option, in case of series of different length to extend the shortest sequence either with mean value (if the variable is in a continuous scale) or with a random label not present in either series (if the variable is categorical).

  * On `crqa()`: 
    * Added default values for arguments in the call of the function. 
    * Included the argument `side` to select the region of the Recurrence Plot to extract measures on
    * Included the argument `checkl`, a wrapper to call the function `checkts()` directly inside this function. 

  * On `optimizeParam()`:
    * Added arguments `min.rec` and `max.rec` to the call. 
    * Added argument within `par` (`fnnpercent`) to estimate False Nearest Neighbours based on a percentage reduction with respect to first dimension (line: 199:241)
    * Simplified code throughout and markedly improved the estimation of the radius (line: 299:360)
    
  * On `runcrqa()` included argument `pad` in the call to work with the revised version of `checkts()`

  * On `wincrqa()` added calculation of TREND (line: 64:87) 

# crqa 1.0.4

  * crqa 1.0.3 did not pass CRAN check because of `DESCRIPTION` (`Depends` field) and was resubmitted as 1.0.4.

# crqa 1.0.3

* New function

  * Added `theiler()` function to choose the separation between values on the time series when specifying a delay reconstruction vector, i.e., the Theiler window.
